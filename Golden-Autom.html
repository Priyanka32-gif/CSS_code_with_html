        <p>The word autumn comes from the anicient Eturscan root auru- and has within it connotations of the passing of the years. It was borrowed by the neighbouring Romans, and became the Lation word autumuns. After the Roman era, the word wontinued to the used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French) or autumpne i Middle English, and was later normalised to the orginal Latin. In the Midieval period., there are rare example of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use. Before the 16th century, harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is commmon in other West Germic languages to working the land to living in towns, the word harvest lost its reference to the time of years and coame to reger only to the actual activity of reaping, and autumn, as well as fall, begin to replace it as referenct ot the season. The alternative wirk fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact drivation is unclear with the Old English fiell or feallan and the Old Nose fall all being possible candidates</p>
